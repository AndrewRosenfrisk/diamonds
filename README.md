# Diamonds

## About

This program features a small algorithm for drawing ASCII-art diamonds of various sizes. 
It contains functions for drawing either an outline or filled-in-style diamond of the 
size you dictate. These functions are good practice for a beginner; try to understand the 
pattern behind the diamond drawings as they increase in size.
